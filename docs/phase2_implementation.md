# Phase 2 Implementation Documentation

## Development and Implementation Process

The data system has been successfully implemented following the concept from phase 1. The implementation focuses on creating a portable, containerized solution using Docker and MongoDB. Here's a breakdown of the key components and implementation steps:

### Database Setup
- MongoDB was chosen as the database solution, running in a Docker container
- The database is configured with proper authentication and health checks
- Data persistence is ensured through Docker volumes
- The setup is defined in `docker-compose.yml` for easy deployment

### Data Ingestion System
- A Python-based data ingestion system has been implemented with optimized batch processing
- The system processes data in batches of 50,000 records for optimal performance
- Key features of the batch processing system:
  - Parallel processing using ThreadPoolExecutor with CPU core-based worker allocation
  - Optimized MongoDB connection pooling (pool size: 50, max pool size: 200)
  - Efficient memory management through chunked CSV reading
  - Robust error handling and validation with detailed logging
  - Schema validation to ensure data quality
  - Performance metrics tracking (records/second, success rate)
- The system has been tested with the current dataset and is designed to handle 5-10 times larger datasets through:
  - Large batch size (50,000 records) optimized for high throughput
  - Parallel processing that scales with available CPU cores
  - Optimized MongoDB connection settings for high throughput
  - Efficient indexing strategy for quick data retrieval
  - Background index creation to minimize impact on write operations

### Containerization and Portability
- The entire system is containerized using Docker
- A custom Dockerfile defines the application environment
- All dependencies are managed through Poetry for Python package management
- The system can be easily deployed to any environment that supports Docker

### Version Control and Reproducibility
- The codebase is stored in a GitHub repository
- All necessary files for running the system are included
- Documentation is provided for setup and usage
- The system can be cloned and run with minimal setup steps

The implementation successfully meets all requirements from phase 1, providing a scalable and maintainable solution for storing sensor data. The system is ready for future expansion with additional sensor types and can be easily migrated to a distributed setup when needed.
