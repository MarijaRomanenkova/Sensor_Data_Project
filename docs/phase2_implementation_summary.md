# Phase 2: Implementation Summary

## Overview
This phase successfully implemented the data processing system based on the concept from Phase 1, using MongoDB as the database solution and Docker for containerization. The implementation includes automated data ingestion, batch processing, and comprehensive testing capabilities.

## Key Components Implemented

### Docker Setup
- **Containerization:** MongoDB and application services containerized using Docker
- **Docker Compose:** Separate configurations for:
  - Main application (`docker-compose.yml`)
  - Isolated testing (`docker-compose.test.yml`)
- **Health Checks:** Implemented for MongoDB to ensure service availability
- **Volume Management:** Persistent storage for MongoDB data

### Data Ingestion
- **Automated Setup:** Database initialization and schema setup automated
- **Batch Processing:** Implemented with configurable batch size (50,000 records)
- **Data Validation:** Comprehensive validation of sensor data
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling and logging

### Testing & Validation
- **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive test suite for data processing
- **Performance Testing:** 
  - Generated synthetic dataset of 500,000 records
  - Achieved processing speed of ~21,559 records/second
  - Memory usage: 186.33 MB
  - 100% success rate in data ingestion

## Challenges & Solutions
Initially, the sample dataset was too small for proper testing. This was addressed by:
1. Creating a synthetic data generator
2. Implementing isolated test environment
3. Running performance tests with 500,000 records
