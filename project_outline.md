# Environmental Sensor Data Processing System

## Project Overview
This project aims to design and implement a data processing system for environmental sensor data collected by a municipality. The system will store and process data from various sensors measuring environmental metrics like temperature, humidity, smoke, etc., with plans to expand to additional metrics in the future.

## Project Phases

### 1. Conception Phase
- [x] 1.1 Sample Data Source Selection
  - Note: Selected IoT Environmental Sensor Dataset from Kaggle

- [x] 1.2 System Goals Documentation
  - Note: Documented in concept draft

- [x] 1.3 Database Solution Selection
  - Evaluate database options
  - Consider scalability and maintainability
  - Document decision and alternatives
  - Note: Selected MongoDB for flexibility and scalability

- [x] 1.4 Implementation Plan
  - Create detailed implementation roadmap
  - Define technical stack
  - Outline development milestones
  - Note: Implemented in project structure and Docker setup

### 2. Development Phase
- [x] 2.1 Environment Setup
  - Install Docker
  - Set up database container
  - Configure development environment
  - Note: Completed with docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile

- [x] 2.2 Database Implementation
  - Create database setup script
  - Define schema and data model
  - Implement data validation
  - Note: Implemented in processor.py with validation ranges

- [x] 2.3 Data Processing Scripts
  - Develop Python scripts for data ingestion
  - Implement batch processing
  - Create data validation and cleaning routines
  - Note: Implemented in processor.py with batch processing and validation

- [x] 2.4 Containerization
  - Create Dockerfile
  - Configure container environment
  - Set up automated build process
  - Note: Completed with Docker configuration

- [x] 2.5 Version Control
  - Initialize GitHub repository
  - Set up project structure
  - Note: Project structure created with proper organization

### 3. Finalization Phase
- [ ] 3.1 System Optimization
  - Implement feedback from tutor
  - Optimize performance
  - Enhance error handling

- [x] 3.2 Documentation
  - Create comprehensive documentation
  - Note: Basic documentation created, needs expansion

- [ ] 3.3 Project Reflection
  - Document lessons learned
  - Identify challenges and solutions
  - Outline future improvements

## Technical Requirements
- [x] Python for data processing scripts
- [x] Docker for containerization
- [x] Distributed database system (MongoDB)
- [x] Scalable architecture
- [x] Portable solution
- [x] Version control with GitHub

## Deliverables
1. [x] Concept document (1/2 DIN A4 page)
2. [ ] Implementation explanation (1/2 DIN A4 page)
3. [ ] Final abstract (2 DIN A4 pages)
4. [x] GitHub repository with working code
5. [x] Technical documentation (basic version)

## Next Steps
1. [x] Begin with sample data source selection
